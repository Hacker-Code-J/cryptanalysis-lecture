What is Caesar cipher? Is it secure?

The Caesar cipher is a simple encryption technique that is named after Julius Caesar, 
who is said to have used it to communicate with his generals. 
It is a substitution cipher that works by shifting each letter of the plaintext message 
a certain number of places down the alphabet.

For example, with a shift of 3, A would be replaced by D, B would become E, and so on. 
The method is based on the alphabetic position of a letter, 
for instance, A=0, B=1, and so on, and each letter is shifted by the amount specified in the key.

While the Caesar cipher is a straightforward encryption technique, 
it is not considered to be secure because it is easily broken with a brute-force attack. 
With only 26 possible keys (one for each letter of the alphabet), 
a computer can quickly try each one until it finds the correct decryption key. 
The Caesar cipher is, therefore, not suitable for encrypting sensitive information.
